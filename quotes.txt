<+Hoolean> IT WAS LAST WEEK YOU PLEBS

<JillyBoel> It's nine o'clock on a saturday
<JillyBoel> The regular crowd shuffles in
<JillyBoel> There's an old man sitting next to me
<JillyBoel> Making love to his tonic and gin
 * JillyBoel laughs
<+JillyBoel> HE SAYS SON CAN YOU PLAY ME A MEMORY
<+JillyBoel> I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW IT GOES
<+JillyBoel> BUT IT'S SAD AND IT'S SWEET AND I KNEW IT COMPLETE
<+JillyBoel> WHEN I WORE A YOUNGER MAN'S CLOTHES
