<@blha303> let me tell you how this project came about
<@blha303> at 10pm yesterday i sat down and thought "what if i advertised every
           service on my network with avahi/bonjour"
<@blha303> so i went looking through this wiki page
           https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Avahi#Adding_Services
<@blha303> and found instructions for adding a QOTD service
<@blha303> "huh, I haven't used QOTD before. wonder how it works"
<@blha303> *investigation*
<@blha303> "well, that seems straightforward. hm, I wonder if I can implement
           this"
<@blha303> and six hours later we have a QOTD server with a wiki interface
